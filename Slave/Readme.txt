It is an simple project about MSP430G2553. It has role as a slave point in my network which is sending temperature data or heartbit if
the master (RPI PI 2B/ 3B+) ask it. The big part of developing is made in C::B and VS. But for compiling I use another way.
I really want to learn how to compile under Linux from terminal to MSP430, so I read and searched how to do it.
Finally I can got the important libraries and compiler(msp-elf-gcc). I made a makefile for that. Now I can compile all the project,
with msp430 header and interrupts and so on. Now it is under testing, how can work on UART.
